    <p class="body-text">26/05/21 | <strong>Brothers Bulldogs would like to thank 2021 Silver Sponsor, and long-term supporter of the club Richard and Fiona Hayes from South Bundy Buses.</strong>
    <br>Starting in 1998 with the takeover of five contracted school bus services which operated from Childers Road, Pine Creek and South Bingera into Bundaberg schools, South Bundy Buses have now expanded to a fleet of 14 vehicles covering the Bundaberg and Childers regions.
    <br>During this time they have regularly supported numerous events across Queensland and Australia with the highlights being the 2000 Sydney Olympics and Paralympic Games, and 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games where they transported numerous athletes and officials.
    <br>Today, South Bundy Buses continues to strive for improvement in quality standards to provide safe, reliable services. Further, they are a proudly local and family operated business with strong ties to the local community through their involvement with local schools, local business and the sporting community.

    <p class="body-text">26/05/21 | <strong>Brothers Bulldogs would like to thank 2021 Silver Sponsors, Blue Dog Concreting.</strong>
    <br>2020 Premiership winner, Club Captian, 2016 Best & Fairest, 150 games and underrated dancer, there is not much Michael “Bluey” Lovett hasn’t done for the mighty Bulldogs.
    <br>We can now add Club Sponsor to the list, with Bluey coming onboard to sponsor the “Best on Ground” for our Senior team every week for the past two seasons.
    <br>In thanking Bluey for his generosity, it would be remiss not to make mention of his better half Melina.
    <br>We could write a long-winded essay here, however we’re pretty sure Michael would be first to tell you that he’s found a good one, and with young Bryan already absolutely loving his footy we’re hoping Bluey & his family stick around for plenty of years yet.

    <h2 class="main-heading"><br>Important Season Information</h2>

    <p class="body-text">15/03/2020 | Today the Wide Bay League advised Brothers Bulldogs that the 2020 AFL Wide Bay Community season is indefinitely postponed due to the current circumstances surrounding the corona virus. At this stage they are hopeful that the Womens competition can still be completed, however, the beginning of the other competitions has been postponed. At this stage we are still able to train, and the league is hopeful that this postponement will only last for a limited time, however, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the circumstances. We are hopeful to know more by Tuesday training, and the clubs will be updated regularly, but there certainly won’t be any footy action prior to Easter. At this stage I am unsure of whether Auskick will continue on Friday nights, but will relay this information as it comes to hand.<br>Ash Charlesworth - Junior Vice President</p>
